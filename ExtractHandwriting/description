To remind people the importance of handwriting, my friends and I write a program to 
extract handwriting from papers, then put the handwriting on your picture, you'll 
get a artistic picture. Meanwhile, you can collect your handwriting and see others 
handwriting(from app). I am not major in image processing, so I find some easy ways 
to make it happen.
